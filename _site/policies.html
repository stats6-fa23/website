<section id="assessment" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="assessment">Assessment</h2>
<p>It is my intent to design assessments that are a source of intellectual curiosity, joy, and learning rather than a source of stress. Assessments serve the purpose of measuring how much you have learned (i.e.&nbsp;how much you have achieved of the course goals). I would recommend you to first focus on your learning, then grades will follow.</p>
<section id="in-class-quizzes" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="in-class-quizzes">In-Class Quizzes</h3>
<p>In-Class quizzes are opportunity to practice as you are learning during the lectures. The questions will be asked sporadically throughout the lectures. You can discuss quiz questions with your neighbors in class, check notes, use internet etc. You will be graded for participation, not for correctness. You need to be attending the lecture in order to receive the participation point. If you are not in participating in lecture or have someone else participate for quizzes on your behalf, this will be considered academic misconduct.</p>
</section>
<section id="homework-assignments" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="homework-assignments">Homework Assignments</h3>
<p>At the end of Wednesday after weekly topics are completed you will be assigned a homework on these topics. You will have until the following lecture to finish the homework assignments. In other words, homework assignments will be due 12:25 pm on Mondays. For homework assignments, you can use books and notes, talk to other people in your class, use online resources including ChatGPT however there are some limitations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use tools and discuss with people to LEARN. Do not use tools or discuss with people to simply copy and submit the homework.</li>
<li>Do not copy as is from the internet or your peers or any other person.</li>
<li>Do not pay someone or a website to do the work for you.</li>
<li>The work you submit should be reflective of <strong>your</strong> understanding. In other words, the teaching assistant and I hold the right to question you anytime about your submission. If you cannot answer about, discuss, articulate what you have submitted then we might look further into if the work submitted is not yours or copied and take appropriate action.</li>
<li>At the end of each homework, you will be asked whether you have done the homework by yourself, with a peer(s), or used tools like ChatGPT. If using ChatGPT, then you will be asked to submit your prompts and how it supported your learning. If you do not acknowledge any help from a person or ChatGPT, we will consider this cheating.</li>
</ul>
<p>TLDR; Use tools or people to help you learn BUT acknowledge in detail how this helped your learning.</p>
</section>
<section id="midterm-exam" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="midterm-exam">Midterm Exam</h3>
<p>Midterm exam will be held in-person, in-class on Nov 1st. You will work individually on the exam. It will be a closed-book exam but you will be given equations. You will not need a calculator and thus you will not be allowed to use one.</p>
</section>
<section id="project" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="project">Project</h3>
<p>You will complete a project with a group mostly in the second half of the quarter. The project will consist of hands-on data analysis. You will apply the methods learned in this course to answer a question(s) that interests you. The project will have multiple components starting in the second half of the quarter. Two of the many components of the project is the proposal and the presentation. You are expected to submit a proposal by Nov 8th at 11:59 pm and submit a final video presentation, along with the final state of data analysis by Dec 11th at 1:30 pm. You will notice that our allocated final exam time for this class is Dec 11th at 1:30 - 3:30 pm. Since we do not have a final exam, during this time, you will be assigned to watch three other groups’ videos and evaluate them.</p>

<section id="late-work-policy" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="late-work-policy">Late Work Policy</h3>
<p>Late work is not accepted except for homework assignments. On homework assignments if the submission is later than the due date and time, then 25% of the achieved total grade will be deducted for every 12 hours that the submission is late. For example, if you were to get 12 points out of 15 on a homework assignment and you submitted 15 hours late then your score would be 6 points.</p>
</section>
<section id="re-grade-requests" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="re-grade-requests">Re-grade Requests</h3>
<p>While we will try our best to make sure that your grade is correct, it is possible for us to make minor mistakes in grading unfortunately. Thus, we strongly encourage you to go over your assignments to check for the correctness of your grade. You should immediately notify us if there are any errors. For all assignments other than the final, you have one-week after receiving feedback and grade from us to ask for regrading to correct any errors. For assignments on Gradescope you can send regrade requests directly within Gradescope. For others, you can email your TA and add me to CC field of the email. Note that the grade on Canvas Gradebook will be the official grade and you should check for its correctness.</p>

<section id="office-hours" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="office-hours">Office Hours</h3>
<p>I would highly encourage you to attend office hours. Attending office hours is an effective way to ask me or your TA questions you may have. They are also a great time to just chat with us if it is not too crowded :)</p>
<p>We want to be mindful of you who commute to campus so if you’d choose to attend office hours virtually, we will also be available online via zoom. The hours and locations can be checked under <a href="./people.html">People</a>. You will need to use your <a href="https://uci.zoom.us/">UCI zoom account</a> to attend the zoom meeting.</p>

<section id="online-discussion" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="online-discussion">Online Discussion</h3>
<p>We will have an <a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/47261">online forum</a>. While communicating online, please note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Before posting a question, please make sure that the same question has not been posted before.</p></li>
<li><p>Respect opinions of others.</p></li>
<li><p>If you choose to post memes or any jokes, be mindful. Any joke about a person, or a group of people, or cultures is not funny. However, statistics and data science jokes are always welcome.</p></li>
<li><p>There are absolutely no stupid questions. Do not feel shy about asking questions. Do not judge anyone about any question that they ask. You can post anonymously. Others would not know who you are but I would know who you are.</p></li>
<li><p>If somebody asks a question about homework etc. do not reveal answers for them. Instead, help them learn and show them in which lecture we have covered the topic.</p></li>
<li><p>Be generous with likes. That means when you read something useful like the post, so that we all know that we are not talking to ourselves but to each other.</p></li>
<li><p>Answer each other’s questions.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="e-mail" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="e-mail">E-Mail</h3>
<p><strong>Please do not email me about course content</strong> unless it is private to you. If you are running into an issue, <strong>it is very likely that someone else is also having the same issue</strong>. Please post on the discussion forum so that we can all learn together. This way I would only answer the question once and everyone can benefit. In fact, your TA or one of your peers may even answer it before I do. You can get a much quicker response.</p>
<p>While communicating over email, please make sure the email - has an informative subject line including the course code. - articulates your question or problem well. - has a closing statement such as <em>Sincerely, Kind Regards</em>* etc. - has your name at the end.</p>
<p>Here is a sample email:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Subject: STATS 6 - Your Subject</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Dear Dr.&nbsp;Dogucu,<br>
I hope you are doing well (or some other humane sentence). I am writing to you regarding ______________ (Your concern or problem). (Any explanations, requests or suggestions for solutions to your problem)<br>

<section id="academic-honesty" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h2>
<p>You are expected to comply to the rules set by the <a href="https://aisc.uci.edu/">Office of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct</a>. This syllabus (i.e., course website) clearly labels instructions on when and how you can work with others, tools you can use, and under what conditions. If there are no instructions for any assignments, you should assume that the work should be completed by you only from start to finish without help of others and AI tools like ChatGPT. Academic dishonesty includes, for example, cheating on examinations or any assignment, plagiarism of any kind (including improper citation of sources), having someone else take an examination or complete an assignment for you (or doing it for someone else), or any activity in which you represent someone else’s work as your own. Violations of academic integrity will be referred to the Office of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct. You cannot share or distribute solutions online or offline or in any media now or in the future. You cannot obtain solutions from others. If there is evidence of academic misconduct , intentionally or unintentionally, YOU WILL FAIL THE CLASS. This rule applies even if you violate the policies of this course on a single problem, on an assignment, the whole assignment or multiple assignments. No matter what the degree of academic dishonesty is, you will fail the class. It is your responsibility to protect your answers being copied. Make sure not to save work on shared folders. It may be difficult to distinguish helping each other learn and cheating together. If you are unsure of the distinction check with me before hand.</p>
